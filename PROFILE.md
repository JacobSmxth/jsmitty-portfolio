## Headline
Student and backend developer focused on Java/Spring Boot and REST APIs, with a growing emphasis on systems-level C. Combines practical software delivery with technical teaching experience; seeks software engineering internship to apply backend and low-level skills in production environments.

## Core Strengths
- Backend architecture with Spring Boot and RESTful design
- Clear technical communication and curriculum building
- Problem solving and debugging across Java, JavaScript, C, and GDScript
- Linux/CLI workflows, Git-based collaboration, and code review
- Teaching and mentoring developers of all ages

## Technical Toolkit
- Languages: C (current focus for systems fundamentals), Java (core for backend work), JavaScript (past web experience), GDScript (curriculum/game work), Bash (daily Linux usage), Python (quick scripting)
- Frameworks/Platforms: Spring Boot; game scripting with Godot
- Databases: H2, CSV/file-based persistence; learning PostgreSQL; JPA with inheritance patterns
- Testing/Quality: global exception handling, validation, layered architecture, code review
- Tools: Git/GitHub, Microsoft 365 collaboration suite, Neovim (custom config)

## Professional Experience
### Code Ninjas — Sensei & Content Team Member (June 2025 – Present)
- Teach programming fundamentals to ages 7–14 (JavaScript, block coding); mentor advanced students through debugging and computational thinking.
- Develop curriculum and co-design the new Unreal Engine learning pathway with distributed teams across the US and Canada.
- Translate Unity projects to Godot GDScript; perform QA on pre-release curriculum; work in agile sprints using Git workflows.
- Built the Code Ninja Bux rewards/progression system; supported an 87% trial-to-membership conversion rate (50 points above national average).

### Freelance Web Developer (2024 – Present)
- Build custom websites and full-stack applications end-to-end, from discovery to deployment.
- Manage client communication, scope, delivery timelines, and post-launch support.

### Tennis Warehouse — Lead Stringer & Quality Checker (Aug 2023 – June 2025)
- Led quality assurance and trained new hires on precision stringing standards in a high-volume environment.
- Managed inventory tracking, equipment maintenance, and process improvements.

### Dunkin Donuts — Crew Member (2021 – 2022)
- Customer service, food prep, and POS operations; developed foundational work ethic and teamwork skills.

## Education
- University of North Georgia — B.S. Cybersecurity & Computer Science (Expected May 2028), GPA 3.38; coursework: Computer Science II, Applied Cybersecurity, Script Programming.
- Denmark High School — Diploma (May 2024), GPA 3.8; AP Computer Science Principles, AP Computer Science A; Varsity Football Captain; Student of the Year.

## Projects (selected)
- **Code Ninjas Bux** — Full reward/progression system with live leaderboards, achievements, and an admin dashboard; Spring Boot backend with planned PostgreSQL (learning) persistence; designed for dojo rollout with scalability for wider adoption. GitHub: github.com/JacobSmxth/code-ninjas-bux.
- **CentDash** — Personal finance API migrating from CSV to database with JPA single-table inheritance, aggregation endpoints, and JPQL queries; demonstrates ORM evolution and validation. GitHub: github.com/jacobsmxth/centdash.
- **InventoryAPI** — Spring Boot 3.5.6 API (Java 21) with CRUD, stock validation, regex SKU checks, and low-stock alerts on H2; ~412 LOC across 9 endpoints. GitHub: github.com/JacobSmxth/inventory-management-api.
- **Task Manager API** — REST API with soft delete + recovery, complex filtering, DTO-based partial updates, and centralized exception handling; ~291 LOC. GitHub: github.com/JacobSmxth/task-manager-api.
- **Ichthys.nvim** — Custom Neovim configuration tuned for Java/Go/Rust/C with LSP, DAP, and telescope workflows for daily development. GitHub: github.com/JacobSmxth/Ichthys.
- Additional work: Washington Archives (10k+ word research site with 52 citations), GoatRewards.com (multi-API client leaderboard), RainbetVIP.com (Telegram + News API automations), Workout Tracker API (11 endpoints; JPA relationships), CentLedger API (foundational finance ledger).

## Teaching & Leadership Highlights
- Designed reward systems and curriculum that boost engagement and retention.
- Mentored students through debugging and project-based learning across multiple languages.
- Led training and quality control programs (Tennis Warehouse) and captained varsity football.

## What I’m Working Toward
- Building production-ready backend services with strong validation, observability, and testing.
- Scaling Code Ninjas Bux from local dojo deployment to broader adoption.
- Continuing to bridge teaching and engineering by shipping tools that make learning engaging.
- Deepening systems skills with a current emphasis on C.

# Portfolio Rebuild Guidance
- Lead with your hybrid identity: “Backend developer & technical instructor building production-ready APIs and gamified learning tools.” Pair with a concise stat (e.g., 87% trial-to-membership conversion or real classroom impact) and a CTA to view projects or contact.
- Use case-study storytelling, not just cards. Spotlight 3–4 projects (Code Ninjas Bux, CentDash, InventoryAPI, GoatRewards) with problem → approach → impact. Include architecture diagrams, API endpoints counts, stack badges, and a short “What I’d improve next.”
- Show teaching impact. Add a “Teaching & Curriculum” section with a clip or screenshots of lesson materials, the dojo rewards system, and a one-liner on outcomes (engagement, conversion lift).
- Make backend depth visible. Provide expandable API docs snippets (OpenAPI excerpts, error shapes, validation rules), testing callouts (error handling and validation), and architectural notes (JPA inheritance choices).
- Credibility signals: add logos/badges for Code Ninjas, client projects, and metrics (87% conversion; 10k+ words/52 citations on Washington Archives). Include a “Recently shipped” changelog to prove activity.
- Services & availability: small section for internship/contract availability, backend/API specialties, and preferred stack (Spring Boot; learning PostgreSQL) with direct calendar/email CTA.
- UX direction: fast, minimal friction. Keep a command palette, add keyboard hints, and ensure a single-scroll “executive summary” on the homepage. Use consistent CTAs: “View case study,” “See GitHub,” “Book a call.”
- Proof over polish: embed live API responses or sandbox calls, and link to GitHub READMEs. Show a short Loom/demo for Code Ninjas Bux and CentDash to convey impact quickly.
