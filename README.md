# Jacob Smith Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. It's a simple single page site built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

**What I Built**

I kept it straightforward no fancy frameworks, just clean code. The site has a dark theme with cyan accents that I think looks professional. It's responsive so it works on phones and desktops.

**Tech Used**

HTML for the structure
CSS for styling (gradients, flexbox, responsive stuff)
JavaScript for smooth scrolling and fade in animations

**Why I Made These Choices**

I wanted something fast and simple. No dependencies means it loads quick. Used semantic HTML for accessibility. The IntersectionObserver thing was new to me it's for triggering animations when you scroll to sections.

For the design, I went with a dark background because I like it, and cyan because it pops against the dark. Kept the layout clean with flexbox for the header.

**Files**
```
index.html (main page)
styles.css (all the styling)
script.js (interactivity)
assets/
  favicon.png (the little icon)
```

That's pretty much it. Simple but effective.
